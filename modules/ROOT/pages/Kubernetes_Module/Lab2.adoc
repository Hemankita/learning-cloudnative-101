== Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about how to use docker and how to run applications using docker.

== Prerequisites

- You need https://www.java.com/en/[Java] installed on your environment. You can download it https://www.java.com/download/[here]. Please install the latest version which is Java Version 8. Make sure you set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. You can verify the version after installation using `java -version`.
- Create a https://hub.docker.com/[DockerHub account]. This account is needed to push images to docker registry. Also create a repository following the instructions https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/[here].
- You need to install https://www.docker.com/[Docker] in your environment. Follow the instructions https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/[here] to install it on Mac and https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/[here] to install it on Windows.

== Working with docker

Before proceeding, make sure docker is properly installed on your system. To verify this, run the below command.

----
docker -v
----

If it is installed, you will see a version number something similar to below.

----
Docker version 19.03.0-beta3, build c55e026
----

[big maroon]*Running a hello-world container*

Let us start with a `hello-world` container. To run a `hello-world` container, use the below command.

----
docker run hello-world
----

If it is successfully run, you will see something like below.

----
$ docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
1b930d010525: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:41a65640635299bab090f783209c1e3a3f11934cf7756b09cb2f1e02147c6ed8
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

For more examples and ideas, visit:
 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
----

Since, `hello-world` image is not existing locally, it is pulled from `library/hello-world`. But if it is already existing, docker will not pull it every time but rather use the existing one.

This image is pulled from https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world. Docker hub is a repository used to store docker images. Similarly, you can use your own registries to store images. For example, IBM Cloud provides you a container registry.

[big maroon]*Verifying the hello-world image*

To verify if an image is existing in your system locally, run the below command.

----
docker images
----

You will then see something like below.

----
$ docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
hello-world         latest              fce289e99eb9        5 months ago        1.84kB
----

== Get the sample application

To get the sample application, you will need to clone it from github.

----
# Clone the sample app
git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudnative_sample_app.git

# Go to the project's root folder
cd cloudnative_sample_app/
----

== Run the application on Docker

=== Build the application

To build the application, use the below command.

----
./mvnw install
----

You will notice something at the end like below once done.

----
[INFO] --- maven-install-plugin:2.5.2:install (default-install) @ cloudnativesampleapp ---

=== Build the docker image

Let's take look at the docker file before building it.

----
FROM ibmjava:8-sfj
LABEL maintainer="IBM Java Engineering at IBM Cloud"

COPY target/cloudnativesampleapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /app.jar

ENV JAVA_OPTS=""
ENTRYPOINT [ "sh", "-c", "java $JAVA_OPTS -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -jar /app.jar" ]
----

- Using the `FROM` instruction, we provide the name and tag of an image that should be used as our base. This must always be the first instruction in the Dockerfile.
- `LABEL` instruction helps us to store metadata.
- Using `COPY` instruction, we copy new contents from the source filesystem to the container filesystem.
- `ENV` instruction helps us to pass environment variables.
- `ENTRYPOINT` allows you to configure a container that runs as an executable.

Once, you have the docker file ready, the nest step is to build it. The `build` command allows you to build a docker image which you can later run as a container.

The command is as follows.

----
$ docker build -t <image_name>:<image_tag> .
----

Here, `-t` flag allows you to add a name to your image and optionally you can also add a tag. If you don't add a tag, by default the tag is `latest`. Also, the `.` at the end of the command specifies that the path for the Dockerfile is the current directory.

To build the docker image for our sample application, run the below command.

----
docker build -t greeting:v1.0.0 .
----

You will see something like below.

----
$ docker build -t greeting:v1.0.0 .

----

To verify if the image is built successfully, run the below command.

----
docker images
----

It shows the images, their repository and tags, and their size.

The output will be as follows.

----
$ docker images

----

=== Run the docker container

- To run the docker container, use the below command.

----
docker run -p <port_to_expose>:<port> -d --name <container_name> <image_name>:<tag>
----

- `-p`: Allows you to publish the containers port to the host.
- `-d`: Runs the container in background in detached mode.
- `--name`: Allows you to specify the name of the container. If you don't use this one, docker creates a name automatically.

To run the docker container for our sample application, use the below command.

----
docker run -p 8080:8080 -d --name greeting greeting:v1.0.0
----

Once done, you will have something like below.

----
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -d --name greeting greeting:v1.0.0
a74b91789b29af6e7be92b30d0e68eef852bfb24336a44ef1485bb58becbd664
----

Also, docker cannot create two containers with the same name. If you try to run the same container having the same name again, you will see something like below.

----
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -d --name greeting greeting:v1.0.0
docker: Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "/greeting" is already in use by container "a74b91789b29af6e7be92b30d0e68eef852bfb24336a44ef1485bb58becbd664". You have to remove (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name.
See 'docker run --help'.
----

It is a good to name your containers. Naming helps you to discover your service easily.

- To list all the running containers, use the below command.

----
docker ps
----

You will see something like below.

----
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
a74b91789b29        greeting:v1.0.0     "sh -c 'java $JAVA_Oâ€¦"   2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes        0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   greeting
----

- To know more about the container, you can inspect the container.

Run the below command.

----
docker inspect <container-name|container-id>
----

By inspecting the container, you can access detailed information about the container. By using this command, you get to know the details about network settings, volumes, configs, state etc.

If we consider our container, it is as follows. You can see lot of information about the `greeting` container.

----
$ docker inspect greeting
[
    {
        "Id": "992723e38ecbdcd50a08d2acc0848e3fb93f182d6e14141e892de5a3f02e14be",
        "Created": "2019-07-15T21:35:18.0277554Z",
        "Path": "sh",
        "Args": [
            "-c",
            "java $JAVA_OPTS -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -jar /app.jar"
        ],
        "State": {
            "Status": "running",
            "Running": true,
            "Paused": false,
            "Restarting": false,
            "OOMKilled": false,
            "Dead": false,
            "Pid": 46656,
            "ExitCode": 0,
            "Error": "",
            "StartedAt": "2019-07-15T21:35:19.0475638Z",
            "FinishedAt": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"
        },
        ..........
        ..........
        ..........
    }
]
----

- To get the logs, you use the below command.

----
docker logs <container-name|container-id>
----

It helps you to access the logs of your container. It allows you to debug the container if it fails. It also lets you to know what is happening with your application.

If we consider our container, it is as follows.

----
$ docker logs greeting
----

At the end, you will see something like below.

----

----

This shows that the Spring Boot application is successfully started.

=== Access the application

- To access the application, open the browser and access http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=John.

You will see something like below.

----
{"id":2,"content":"Welcome to Cloudnative bootcamp !!! Hello, John :)"}
----

[maroon]*Container Image Registry*

Container Image Registry is a place where you can store the container images. They can be public or private registries. They can be hosted by third party as well. In this lab, we are using DockerHub.

=== Pushing an image to a Registry

Let us now push the image to docker hub registry.

- Before pushing the image to the registry, one needs to login. Let us now login into the docker hub registry.

----
$ docker login
----

Enter your Docker Hub credentials.

----
$ docker login
Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one.
Username: <user_name>
Password:
Login Succeeded
----

- Tag your image. To push an image to a registry, you need to tag it with the repository name and port (port is optional). This command helps you to do that.

----
$ docker tag <src_image_name>:<tag> <repository_name>/<target_image>:<tag>
----

Let us now tag the image we built previously.

----
$ docker tag greeting:v1.0.0 <repository_name>/greeting:v1.0.0
----

- Now push the image to the registry. This allows you to share images to a registry.

----
docker push <repository_name>/<image_name>:<tag>
----

In our case, it will be as follows.

----
docker push <repository_name>/greeting:v1.0.0
----

If everything goes fine, you will see something like below.

----
$ docker push <repository_name>/greeting:v1.0.0
The push refers to repository [docker.io/<repository_name>/greeting]
2e4d09cd03a2: Pushed
d862b7819235: Pushed

----

Once the push is successful, your image will be residing in the registry.

=== Clean Up

- To stop the container, run the below command.

----
docker stop <container-name|container-id>
----

For our sample application, it is as follows.

----
$ docker stop greeting
greeting
----

- To remove the container, run the below command.

----
docker rm <container-name|container-id>
----

For our sample application, it is as follows.

----
$ docker rm greeting
greeting
----

- To remove the image, run the below command.

----
docker rmi <image_id>
----

Get the image_ids and then remove them. Use the below commands to do that.

----
$ docker images

----

=== Pulling an image from the registry

Sometimes, you may need the images that are residing on your registry. Or you may want to use some public images out there. Then, we need to pull the image from the registry.

To pull the image from the registry, use the below command.

----
$ docker pull <repository_name>/<image_name>:<tag>
----

Since, we deleted the one we created previously, let us now push it from the registry.

----
$ docker pull <repository_name>/greeting:v1.0.0
----

If it successfully got pulled, we will see something like below.

== Run the application on Docker using multi-stage build

In this, building the application is a part of the docker image. It automatically does it for you. You need not run `mvn install` explicitly.

=== Build the docker image

Let's take look at the docker file before building it.

----
# Build stage - could use maven or our image
FROM maven:3.3-jdk-8 as builder

# Creating Work directory
ENV BUILD_DIR=/usr/src/app/
RUN mkdir $BUILD_DIR
WORKDIR $BUILD_DIR

# Reuse local .m2. if not all the dependencies will be always downloaded
# This can be removed if you want to
VOLUME ${HOME}/.m2:/root/.m2
ADD . /usr/src/app

RUN bash -c " mvn clean install"

FROM ibmjava:8-sfj as runner

# Install Extra Packages
RUN apt-get update \
 && apt-get install -y jq bash bc ca-certificates curl \
 && update-ca-certificates

# Create app directory
ENV APP_HOME=/app
WORKDIR $APP_HOME

# Copy jar file over from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/target/cloudnativesampleapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar $APP_HOME
RUN mv ./cloudnativesampleapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar

ENV JAVA_OPTS=""
ENTRYPOINT [ "sh", "-c", "java $JAVA_OPTS -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -jar ./app.jar" ]
----

This Dockerfile leverages multi-stage builds, which lets you create multiple stages in your Dockerfile to do certain tasks.

In our case, we have two stages.

- The first one uses `maven:3.3-jdk-8` as its base image to download and build the project and its dependencies using Maven.
- The second stage uses `ibmjava:8-sfj` as its base image to run the compiled code from the previous stage.

The advantage of using the multi-stage builds approach is that the resulting image only uses the base image of the last stage. Meaning that in our case, we will only end up with the `ibmjava:8-sfj` as our base image, which is much tinier than having an image that has both Maven and the JRE.

By using the multi-stage builds approach when it makes sense to use it, you will end up with much lighter and easier to maintain images, which can save you space on your Docker Registry. Also, having tinier images usually means less resource consumption on your worker nodes, which can result cost-savings.

To build the docker image, run the below command.

----
docker build -f Dockerfile.multistage -t greeting:v2.0.0 .
----

You will see something like below.

----
$ docker build -f Dockerfile.multistage -t greeting:v2.0.0 .
