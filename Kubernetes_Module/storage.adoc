== Volumes

A volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod.  A volume in kubernetes has a explicit lifetime which is the same as the pod that encloses it. Since a volume in a pod outlives any containers that run within the pod, the data on the volume can be preserved for multiple containers that start up within the pod. Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously.
