== Pods

A Pod is the basic execution unit of a Kubernetes applicationâ€“the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model that you create or deploy. A Pod represents processes running on your cluster. Pods can run a single container or multiple containers at one time.

=== ReplicaSets

A ReplicaSet is a defined set of fields that declares the number of replicas needed to obtain the desired state. 

=== ReplicationControllers

The ReplicationController controls the number of pod replicas running at one time in a cluster.  The ReplicationController is responsible for ensuring the correct number of pods are replicated and running. Pods maintained by a ReplicationController are automatically replaced 

== Deployments

A kubernetes deployment describes the desired state for a kubernetes cluster. The deployment controller changes the actual state to meet the desired state at a controlled rate.  Changes to a deployment can lead to new ReplicaSets, removal of previous deployments and allocate the resources for the new deployment.


== Try It Out

The link below will take you to Katacoda to walk you through creating a deployment and service via a YAML file. You will also change the number of replicas for the deployment and see how it automatically deploys the replicas for you.
