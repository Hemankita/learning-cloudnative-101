== Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to get started using Kubernetes by creating a new Kubernetes cluster on your IBM Cloud account.  We are going to walk through how to *Create a Kubernetes Resource* using the IBM Cloud Dashboard. *Create a Cluster* and navigate through the *Kubernetes Cluster Dashboard* to see information about your created cluster.

== Prerequisites

- You will need an IBM Account for https://cloud.ibm.com/[IBM Cloud]
- Downloaded and installed the Kubernetes CLI at https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[Kubernetes CLI Installation]. Follow the instructions for your computer's operating system.
- Downloaded and installed the IBM Cloud CLI at https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started#step1-install-idt[IBM Cloud CLI Installation]. Follow the instructions for your computer's operating system..
